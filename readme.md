What's the point of Krocket? It looks stupid!

You look stupid, stupid face. You're probably adopted, too, which explains the negativity.

Krocket is a **very** small scale game for PC/Linux/Mac developed in order to improve my programming skills. It's not designed to be a top quality title, well polished, or even all that original. In a running race against the plethora of indedepent games out there, it's probably sitting comfortably in last place at the starting line with its middle finger stuck up in the air, shouting a big **fuck you** to anyone that cares to notice it. Basically, it's not going to win any awards any time soon.

In my quest to become a half-decent game developer, Krocket is the first step. You see, what Krocket **does** have going for it is this: it's not just a mess of unintelligible code, an abandoned game without an ending, or a pipe dream concept that will never come to fruition. I already have plenty of those. No matter how small and simple it may be, it is a fully complete product sitting at version 1.0. It's a game, a real game! I promise!

One Game a Month
-----
One Game a Month, or 1GAM, is a challenge for game developers amateur and professional alike. For every month of 2013 we are to release a new game, purely for our own benefit. We get superficial experience points and can rank ourselves against other participants, sure, but the idea is to focus on improving our personal development processes. Starting off simple and gradually improving the level of complexity, I hope to release a game for as many months of the year as I can. 

Krocket is my release for January.

Shut up & let me play!

Oops, sorry! As it's currently only **just** January at the time of writing this, Krocket is not yet ready for release. For the technologically adept, its source code can be found in the GitHub repository above. Be warned, however - despite my claims, it is not a playable game or even close to version 1.0.

I kind of wrote this expecting any readers to be in February already. You're just too quick!
